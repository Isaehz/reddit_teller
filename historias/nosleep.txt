The Frequency That Follows Me:

I’ve always been obsessed with sound. As a freelance podcaster, I spend hours tinkering with my equipment—condenser mics, mixers, noise filters—trying to capture the perfect audio. Last month, I was working on a new episode, something mundane about local history, when I noticed it: a faint hum buried in the background of my recording. It wasn’t feedback or interference from my cheap apartment’s wiring. It was steady, low, almost like a heartbeat but sharper, more mechanical. I couldn’t edit it out no matter how hard I tried.

At first, I thought it was just an annoyance. I re-recorded the segment three times, swapped out cables, even moved my setup to the kitchen table. The hum was still there, persistent, threading through every file like it was mocking me. I gave up and uploaded the episode anyway, figuring listeners wouldn’t notice. That was my first mistake.
